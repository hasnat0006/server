credential management improves the efficiency of universities
in storing and verifying degree-related data [7].
Abstract—The growing prevalence of certificate forgery in
today's digital age poses a significant threat that undermines the
integrity of educational qualifications. This study explores the
potential of blockchain and generative AI to optimize the
certificate validation process and combat certificate
falsification. The research adopts the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
guidelines for literature review. The findings reveal that
integrating blockchain and generative AI can effectively reduce
certificate forgery, enhance the accuracy and reliability of
certificate data, and streamline the employee recruitment
process by providing faster and more precise validation. This
approach curbs certificate fraud and improves the quality of
education and the workforce.
Beyond the issue of diploma forgery, educational data is
often stored in centralized systems, making it vulnerable to
hacking or manipulation by unauthorized parties. The lack of
data transparency within these systems can seriously affect
universities and other educational institutions [8]. This context
makes the implementation of blockchain technology
particularly compelling for verifying degrees, sharing
academic certificates, and recording learning outcomes.
Blockchain technology in educational institutions can
significantly enhance data security, transparency, and
integrity [9].
However, blockchain alone may not fully address all
challenges. Issues such as slow administrative processes,
human error, and the proliferation of fake degrees continue to
undermine the quality of human resources in Indonesia, where
individuals need more qualifications [10]. Integrating
blockchain technology with generative AI can address these
problems more effectively.

I. INTRODUCTION
Education is a critical investment for boosting economic
development in Indonesia. However, the quality of education
in Indonesia is still considered low compared to other ASEAN
countries. The government has implemented various policies
and programs to address this issue, including digitizing
education. The technology that can advance education
includes e-learning, the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain,
and artificial intelligence (AI).
Generative AI can analyze patterns, detect anomalies in
large datasets, and provide an additional layer of security and
efficiency. It can also automate administrative processes,
reducing human error and accelerating the validation of
academic credentials. The collaboration between blockchain
and generative AI is crucial for optimizing security,
transparency, efficiency, and accuracy in managing
educational data.
These advancements reflect the education system's
adaptation to better prepare younger generations for future
demands. Among these technologies, blockchain has recently
gained traction in education [1]. Blockchain holds significant
potential for improving the education industry through smart
contracts, a decentralized application program for data
management, security, and integrity [2].
In light of these considerations, this study aims to analyze
the potential of blockchain technology, enhanced by
generative AI, in combating diploma forgery and improving
educational data management. By leveraging these
technologies, academic institutions can optimize their data
validation processes' speed, accuracy, and efficiency,
ultimately enhancing the quality and reliability of educational
credentials in Indonesia.
The adoption of Blockchain within educational
institutions has increased in recent years, as blockchain offers
several advantages [3]. The data managed by smart contracts
is more secure and transparent, reducing the risk of errors and
fraudulent activities [4]. Furthermore, blockchain can play an
essential role in the educational sector by combating the
falsification of degrees and the validity of academic
credentials [5][6]. Blockchain implementation in academic

and reporting systematic reviews. PRISMA provides a
structured approach to identifying, selecting, and evaluating
relevant literature, ensuring transparency and rigor in the
review process. It is an established standard for synthesizing
evidence in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, as Samala
et al. (2023) noted.
C. Stage 3 (Reporting Stage)
In this stage, 36 articles will be processed using
explanatory descriptive techniques. This report will be
separated into five sections, including an overview and
research objectives. This information must provide vital
insight for readers because the articles selected in this research
have passed a strict screening process.
A. Stage 1 (Planning Stage)
The planning stage involves defining the research
objectives, keywords, and inclusion and exclusion criteria.
This research aims to explore how blockchain technology and
generative AI can combat diploma forgery. Key search terms,
including "Blockchain in Education," "Smart Contract,"
"Academic Certificate," "Academic Validity," and
"Generative AI in Education," were identified to shape the
initial search criteria. These keywords set the research
parameters and offer a comprehensive overview of the current
applications of blockchain and generative AI in the education
sector.

Fig. 1. Search, filter, and review process.
After processing the 36 selected articles using descriptive
techniques, the analysis will focus on extracting key insights
and patterns related to integrating blockchain and generative
AI in educational data management.
The initial search covered several bibliographic repositories,
including IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, ProQuest, and Google
Scholar. The search was conducted in November 2023 and
included articles published between November 2018 and
January 2024. A total of 1,139 results met the search criteria.
III. RESULT
The following sections will present the findings, which
offer a comprehensive view of how blockchain and generative
AI can enhance academic data integrity and combat diploma
forgery. The results section will detail the outcomes of this
analysis, highlighting the potential impact and practical
implications for educational institutions.
B. Stage 2 (Filter and Review Stage)
The remaining 90 articles were screened at this stage using
the main inclusion/exclusion criteria. This filtering stage has
a 2 step filtering process. First, we read the title, abstract, and
keywords, and then we discarded articles that were excluded
from inclusion. The second step is the reading process. We
read the contents of the articles thoroughly to find papers to
review. The final number of articles in the review process was
36. This review will be based on the initial research objectives,
which include research questions :
